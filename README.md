<u>Chebyshev.cpp</u> contains Chebyshev propagator I used for the propagation of wavepackets in multistate system.
It is written with the aim of including time-dependent terms in Hamiltonian though this is different from the propagator with time-dependent Hamiltnoian
This is best used when there aren't any non-adiabatic interactions OR diabatic interactions are present.
